                                has visited the site, their IP address an timezone.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis:</span> Using Cookies to do all three tasks was pretty straight forward. there are already several implementations available online
                                I decided however to add a cookie reset and a refresh.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Documentation:</span> I added comments to the code where comments seemed to be needed. Most documentation is referencing to within the code itself. </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="font-weight-bold">User Guide:</span> To begin, follow the following steps:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Click on Part 1 on the global navbar.</li>

                                <span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis:</span> Used mySQL database to record all the locations of the images. It is similar to my TMA1 implementation
                                however, I sued mySQL instead of the browser's session. The Shuffle button works at random usig C# rando function.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Documentation:</span> I added comments to the code where comments seemed to be needed. Most documentation is referencing to within the code itself. </li>

                                the general outline functionality of the site. This allows the user to browse around, login and select and add configured Laptops and parts to their cart. Their cart isn't 100% fucntional
                                as there is no database linked to this part. Part 4 is the more advanced and fully functional website.
