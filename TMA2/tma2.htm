            <p>To Run, simply go the the website link <a class="bold" href="http://elninokr.com/TMA2/tma2.htm">elninokr.com/TMA2/tma2.htm</a></p>
            <p>You can also run the <a class="bold" href="tma2.htm">tma2.htm</a> in your local browser after downloading the files. 
              You will require some local server such as XAMPP. Also modify the <a class="bold" href="./shared/connection.php">connection.php</a> file in the shared directory to match the your local 
              host database setup. Then using the "setupDatabase.sql" file to configure and setup your local database.</p>

            Here are some documentation and comments on each projects:

            <h4>Part 1</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Description:</span> This section consists of the Online Bookmarking portion of the Website. The User can either Login or 
                SignUp then the user can add, edit and delete valid urls. In addition, they can view the top liste bookmarks on all pages.</li>  
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis:</span> I used a one to many relationship between the users and the bookmarks in order to map out the database 
                where the username is the foreign key for the Bokkmark Entity. Used PHP for login and logi validity. Also, I used jquery to setup functions and read from HTML. 
                The reason behind this and not using vanilla javascript is because I'm a native Javascript/ReactJS user so I wanted to test out jquery as it is heavily used around the world. 
                Also I attempted to use PHP session to control active login by the user, however it kept giving me errors so I based my solution to matching cookies saved when user logs in and removed when
              the user logged out. This solution was implemented by W3Schools (which I referenced in the code). I used PHP to cmmunicate with the database and call in queries which resulted in being very easy and efficient.</li>  
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Documentation:</span> I added comments to the code where comments seemed to be needed. Most documentation is referencing to within the code itself. </li>  
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">User Guide:</span> To begin, follow the following steps:
                <ul>
                  <li>Click on Part 1 on the global navbar.</li>
                  <li>You can always view the Top Ten Bookmarked Pages.</li>
                  <li>SignUp by clicking sign up and inputing a username and password.</li>
                  <li>You will be automaitcally logged in. However, you can alternatively login if a user account already created.</li>
                  <li>User can then add a bookmark and if an error occurs, the user will be displayed a message.</li>
                  <li>After a bookmarkis added, the user can edit or delete that bookmark.</li>
                  <li>When done, the user can log out or simply exit the screen. The user will be automaically logged in at their next visit since they haven't logged out.</li>
                </ul>  
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Part 2</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Description:</span> This section consists of the Online School portion of the Website. The user can log in and load a class and start it.</li>  
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Analysis:</span> I used several relationships (that are outlined in the diagram below). My XML file was based off the book and my previous assignement information. 
                I decided to divide it into Units, Chapters and Sections to match the Book's Outline. This part was difficult to create but I managed. these small details always seem the hardest. I implemented a XML parser 
                in jquery based off of my XML. I also created a upload php and reader php file to communicate with the database. User can select a course and either type up the path or choose it from their folders.
              </li>  
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Documentation:</span> I added comments to the code where comments seemed to be needed. Most documentation is referencing to within the code itself. </li>  
              <li><span class="font-weight-bold">User Guide:</span>  To begin, follow the following steps:
                <ul>
                  <li>Click on Part 2 on the global navbar.</li>
                  <li>You can always view some cool facts on both sides of the page.</li>
                  <li>SignUp by clicking sign up and inputing a username and password.</li>
                  <li>You will be automaitcally logged in. However, you can alternatively login if a user account already created.</li>
                  <li>User can then add a class that is in then XML format. For this part, there is a ready xml files in "./part2/units/unit1.xml", "./part2/units/unit2.xml" and "./part2/units/unit3.xml". The user can add this to the file pathname or find it using the
                    file explorer option. Both with report back an error if the user selected a file that is not in the corrwect format.</li>
                  <li>User will have all the units dsiplayed. The user can select and attempt to read and do a quiz.</li>
                  <li>There is a back button for the user to use and a grade button for the user to grade their quiz.</li>
                  <li>When done, the user can log out or simply exit the screen. The user will be automaically logged in at their next visit since they haven't logged out.</li>
                </ul>  
              </li>
            </ul>
